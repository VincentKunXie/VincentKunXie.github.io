        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>I am a fourth year computer science student at Western University (class of 2017). I was in the faculty of engineering at my first year, and I got the Western Scholarship of Excellence ($2000). Then I spent the first term of my second year in Software Engineering before I transferred to Computer Science, therefore I had a long time experience of engineering science with C++. </p><br>
        <p>I am very interested in developing web front-end projects, and I like the front-end languages (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript). In addition to this, I love designing UI related projects, including image and music. I also have experience in CorelDraw x7 and Fruit Studio 12. I am a very patient and calm person and I am looking forward to working with new people and learning new stuff.</p><br>
